AGILE breaks down development into two-week long sprints. This could be used for advanced time management. This is suitable as it AGILE focuses on reducing time-to-market, resource efficiency, and flexibility. 

At the end of each sprint, user feedback is necessary for guiding the goals of the next sprint. This leads to iteration and improvement.

These should match the issues on the repo project.
