V1 - BWG25 - 25/11/26 - Broad project aims, to be reviewed collaboratively

Project Title: Mad Swans Booking Prototype
Aims: Design and build a prototype booking solution for a multi-sport country club (Mad Swans).

Scope:
- To produce a design for full web app and determine technical feasibility of features.
- To build a demo site with the minimum viable product.
- To present a clear business proposal for our solution. (Executive summary / Non scientific communication)

Objectives:
1. Build an interactive web app using licensed packages with core features which can be demoed by April 30th.
2. Develop a business strategy and product development timeline by April 1st to demonstrate to customers what further features they can expect - necessary for investment. 

## WP1 : Client needs and solutions
Aim: To identify key needs of several users of the service and potential technical solutions.
Tasks:
1. Research into current practices, issues, and desired features.
2. Translate user needs into technical requirements
3. Investigate possible solutions to fulfil these requirements
4. Empirically choose solutions (choice matrix) with weightings for complexity, time, setup cost, and operational cost.
5. Product production costing - estimate the operational and upfront costs for developing and sustaining this web app to be conveyed to stakeholders.
Milestones: Client research completion. Ideation of solutions. Selection of chosen designs.
Deliverables: D1 - Completed design and development matrix with related choice matrix. D2 - Presentation of features with predicted costing
Risks: User needs may develop unpredictably during the project causing delays.

## WP2 : Backend development
Aim: To select and develop a data architecture suitable for the specification. 

## WP3 : Frontend integration

## WP4 : Website Design
Aim: To produce a cohesive brand-aligned graphical interface for the website.
